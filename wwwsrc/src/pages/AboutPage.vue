    <p class="text-light">I have been creating chalkboard designs for several years now. I have a passion for taking an image that someone would like to have in their home or for a life event like a wedding and making that picture come to life through my chalkboards. I would love the opportunity to make a board for you.
      <br>
      When I am not creating a new chalkboard you can find me spending time with my husband and my new baby boy. I love serving in my church and going on coffee dates with friends. I enjoy connecting and meeting new people. Feel free to reach out so we can connect!
